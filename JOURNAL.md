## 10/10/2025 - Started KiCad Project  

Didn't really do a lot, just started the KiCad Project and labeled all the MCU pins for the controller.

Well, pretty much it, but I need 250 characters, so I will talk about blueprint. I kinda am liking it, it is obviously a continuation of Highway, but I like it. Ngl kinda feels unoriginal, but I still like it. 

It is basically Highway, but with some parts of SoM and more refined.
