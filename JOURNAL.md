## 10/10/2025 5 PM - Started KiCad Project  

Didn't really do a lot, just started the KiCad Project and labeled all the MCU pins for the controller.

Well, pretty much it, but I need 250 characters, so I will talk about blueprint. I kinda am liking it, it is obviously a continuation of Highway, but I like it. Ngl kinda feels unoriginal, but I still like it. 

It is basically Highway, but with some parts of SoM and more refined.  

## 10/10/2025 8 PM - Finished V1 Power Circuit  

I basically made the schematic for the power supply.

Most of the time was spent researching and seeing what I had to do to make sure it is safe and everything gets what it wants. I am debating getting the Power on a different board, but I don't think I will.
But now I have battery level, 3.3v (MCU), 5v (display), 12v (misc like lights). 
I made a more complex circuit, but then I realized eBike batteries already have a BMS ðŸ˜­ so I got rid of it.
So far, kinda liking this, but I am dreading the day I have to make a case, especially waterproof :(  

## 10/10/2025 9 PM - Added Connectors  

I went through and did all the tedious work of creating the connectors.

I was also thinking about the features I am going to add specifically for anti-theft. I want to have enough smart anti-theft features that you don't need to lock your bike up. So I will have things like PIN, Phone detection to make sure you can ride it. To make sure that if you do try to steal it, you won't be able to, I will lock the motor, start an alarm, pretty much cut power, other than to the anti-theft features, oh, and also GPS. So this would be effective, but thieves could still pick it up, take out the battery, and other things so I will probably still carry one around, but for those times when you forget it, then you can still be calm knowing your bike won't get stolen.  

## 10/11/2025 1 PM - Motor Controller  

I finished the Motor connection and etc.

So I used a BLDC motor IC for easy controlling and etc. Honestly I don't get why eBike controller are so expensive this seems down right resonable.
When I brake it will now automatically cut power to the motor no matter what (Hard wired) and I can control it with firmware too. So now I am going to go through and finish a few things then I will test it in a simulation and then I should be good to go to the PCB.  

## 10/11/2025 4 PM - Footprints  

I hate selecting footprints; let's make that clear right now, I hate it.

I ran the ERC and fixed all those problems, and I moved to selecting the footprints. I got a list on Digi-Key for all my parts, but I hate this still. A big, big problem I am facing right now is that I need 3 buck converters for 3.3v, 5v, and 12v. Someone suggested going from 12v to 5v then to 3.3v so I will try that.  

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - 48v -> 24v  

Ok for the past 2 hours I have been working on the buck converters.

Tell me why it is so hard to just go down to a lower voltage doesn't make sense but whatever. I spent1.5 hours trying to make my own but the n I came across a actual life saver [webench.ti.com/power-designer](webench.ti.com/power-designer). I got done my 24v converter and now the rest
