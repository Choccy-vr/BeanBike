## 10/10/2025 5 PM - Started KiCad Project  

Didn't really do a lot, just started the KiCad Project and labeled all the MCU pins for the controller.

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTUxMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a9143516e9c36189a78fa9728de7c93dc4bf3c46/image.png)


Well, pretty much it, but I need 250 characters, so I will talk about blueprint. I kinda am liking it, it is obviously a continuation of Highway, but I like it. Ngl kinda feels unoriginal, but I still like it. 

It is basically Highway, but with some parts of SoM and more refined.  

## 10/10/2025 8 PM - Finished V1 Power Circuit  

I basically made the schematic for the power supply.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTUzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8241470e2299ee4d2047ad70ae19330d94f9d8c5/image.png)
Most of the time was spent researching and seeing what I had to do to make sure it is safe and everything gets what it wants. I am debating getting the Power on a different board, but I don't think I will.
But now I have battery level, 3.3v (MCU), 5v (display), 12v (misc like lights). 
I made a more complex circuit, but then I realized eBike batteries already have a BMS 😭 so I got rid of it.
So far, kinda liking this, but I am dreading the day I have to make a case, especially waterproof :(  

## 10/10/2025 9 PM - Added Connectors  

I went through and did all the tedious work of creating the connectors. 
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTU0MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e89d0bf58e68c16cda045891f44fc5b6902c0a66/image.png)
I was also thinking about the features I am going to add specifically for anti-theft. I want to have enough smart anti-theft features that you don't need to lock your bike up. So I will have things like PIN, Phone detection to make sure you can ride it. To make sure that if you do try to steal it, you won't be able to, I will lock the motor, start an alarm, pretty much cut power, other than to the anti-theft features, oh, and also GPS. So this would be effective, but thieves could still pick it up, take out the battery, and other things so I will probably still carry one around, but for those times when you forget it, then you can still be calm knowing your bike won't get stolen.  

## 10/11/2025 1 PM - Motor Controller  

I finished the Motor connection and etc.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY0MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--03ccd02f88be4c9362fb244c248106f154a25d63/image.png)
So I used a BLDC motor IC for easy controlling and etc. Honestly I don't get why eBike controller are so expensive this seems down right resonable.
When I brake it will now automatically cut power to the motor no matter what (Hard wired) and I can control it with firmware too. So now I am going to go through and finish a few things then I will test it in a simulation and then I should be good to go to the PCB.  

## 10/11/2025 4 PM - Footprints  

I hate selecting footprints; let's make that clear right now, I hate it.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--02d80125252332b05c6f6fb64ecf9d814c531c28/image.png)
I ran the ERC and fixed all those problems, and I moved to selecting the footprints. I got a list on Digi-Key for all my parts, but I hate this still. A big, big problem I am facing right now is that I need 3 buck converters for 3.3v, 5v, and 12v. Someone suggested going from 12v to 5v then to 3.3v so I will try that.  

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - 48v -> 24v  

Ok for the past 2 hours I have been working on the buck converters.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY5OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--883f798163d37c0d06bf2b47560470d24ca28e1a/image.png)
Tell me why it is so hard to just go down to a lower voltage doesn't make sense but whatever. I spent1.5 hours trying to make my own but the n I came across a actual life saver [webench.ti.com/power-designer](webench.ti.com/power-designer). I got done my 24v converter and now the rest  

## 10/11/2025 8 PM - Finished V1 Schematic  

I finally finally finished V1 of my motor controller!
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTcxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e81ce31382838081d9f66ed0659053e2d6eead8b/image.png)
You know how earlier I said I don't get why motor controllers are so expensive? Yeah, I take that back. I finished all the conversions and now have 24v, 12v, 5v, and 3.3v available to me, all at around 2.5A. I thought the inductors would've made this huge, but ehh, I am estimating around 100mm by 90mm. Then, to top it all off, I did footprints my favorite.  

## 10/12/2025 3 PM - Started PCB  

I started on the PCB.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTg2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--89756bc4c9c01c7c5119c1e327a72a686d879c30/image.png)
I started by grouping the components into sections of the board, like one group for power, one for motor, one for connectors, and one for the MCU. I then combined them into a compact layout, drew my edge cuts, and started plotting traces. I have done most of the power, and now I am on data. The board will have 4 layers, front and back for power, and the middle layers for data. After I finish it, I will probably ask someone to review it because this is my first PCB with a lot of current, and I need it to be safe.  

## 10/12/2025 9:29 PM - Finished V1 PCB  

I finished routing all the PCB, and it should be good!
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--72c7977c4bda1612ea090db430647902a0f86e98/image.png)
To be honest, I am not that confident, so that is why I am getting it reviewed by someone a lot smarter than me. This feels really nice to get done. I would say this is the hardest part; it should all be smooth sailing from here. And best of all, software is next! Oh, also, I forgot to run to DRC, guess I have to do that :( I really hate all the repetitive work of making PCBs like it is fun until you get to that part.  

## 10/12/2025 9:48 PM - Quick Update: DRC & Silkscreen  

Quick update: I fixed DRC violations and added silk screen text.  
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTkyMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3a524b9488808c1dd136c4c42497d863675c9223/image.png)
I don't think I am done with it completely. I still have to add all the part numbers, but really, I already have them picked out; I just need to put them in and generate the BOM and Gerbers. It is easy but repetitive. Welp, see you then  

## 10/14/2025 - PCB v2  

I have done alot of research and getting feedback.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI1NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d4da2f98b9ea5b46ba5ad298e70d54c87835423a/image.png)
I have gotten feedback on my PCB and how not to burn down my house. I need to majorly increase the track width but I have decided to just up my board to 6 layers and it would be like this. Back:Solid GND In4:PWR_MOTOR then the rest is yet to be decided but that is what is new. Then in v1 signals were being passed from one area to another (mostly at connectors) so I am fixing that. I felt it would be easier to just redo the routing and as a perk I can make it neater.  

## 10/15/2025 - Layout PCB v2  

I have laid out all of PCB v2 this time, taking a lot more care into it.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjQxOCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--51fb2eb957b323b2416679f8a18b720a91a96e1b/image.png)
I have decided to omit the 24V and 12V lines. Really, I had no use for them other than lights, but after seeing how expensive wired-in lights are, I decided against it. The PCB is split into 3 parts now: MCU, Power, and Motor. I am still deciding whether to arrange it vertically or more horizontally, but I am thinking vertically.  

## 10/16/2025 6 PM - Issues  

Well, I laid out my PCB v2, and it's all good, but there is an issue.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjU0NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5e7ac3b7661c56ba94f7b6e6dff487882c250a19/image.png)
So I laid out my PCB, it was all nice and neat, but ... I just now realized that the chip I was using the DRV8308 does not support 48v :(. So I have to replace it. I am replacing it with the DRV8353. It is a newer chip and supports 48v. But I really do not want to change everything.  

## 10/16/2025 9 PM - Updated Motor IC  

So after a lot, I finally got the motor IC all updated.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjU2MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7aca53cf954b7236a22347976da6a951a3997245/image.png)
It was a lot, but I think I finally have this all down, and it feels so nice. One good thing happened, though I had the MOSFETs mixed up, so that would not have been good. I rearranged the GPIOs to make it fit a lot better. I also got to get rid of the level shifters, and I feel it is a lot less complex.  

## 10/18/2025 - PCB v2  

I routed a placed everything on PCB v2 and it should be finished.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzExMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--374cd558e1936bfda9d718b1a325a3058ea63345/image.png)
Been a while. But I finished everything on PCB v2 (except silkscreen). I placed all the new components updated it and all nice and neat. I added copper fills for connecting my high-power things so I don't have to worry about big traces. But anyway, now I am getting it reviewed once again to make sure it is very good.  

## 10/19/2025 11 AM - Finish PCB v2  

I had a problem with my PCB, but I fixed it, and now v2 is officially finished.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzM5MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--80aeae5ce28ee01168b97e2b7e07c51e8dc029dc/image.png)
In my PCB, there were some isolated copper islands, so I had to fix that by re-routing some of the PCB. This should be the actual PCB that I send to JLC PCB. Now I'm going to make the firmware, and it shouldn't be too hard. Altough I have never interacted with a SPI device without a library so that will take a bit.  

## 10/19/2025 3 PM - DRV8353 implementation  

I am finally working on firmware!
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQ5MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--20ec2375586308a90d845129184ca8e4d080ea64/image.png)
Right now, I am working on the DRV8353 implementation. I have Fault detection working. For everywhere you see uart.sendData(), that is me sending data to my display (the smart thing) to see what it will decide to do with it. At first, I was a little nervous because I had never read/write raw registries from SPI, but it is kind of easy. Oh, and I also set up an interrupt on the FAULT pin to make sure I catch all faults instantly. Next up is Driver Control.  

## 10/19/2025 8 PM - Finished DRV8353 implementation  

I finished the DRV8353 implementation.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzU4NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--aab45e828bd38e1064ff4453d20c8568d506969e/image.png)
Note, this does not mean that my controller firmware is done, just that the code to interface with the DRV8353 is done. Anyway, I added a bunch of functions to control all the different registries. Next, I have to make the motor control code (PAS, Cruise Control, actually sending PWM signals, getting motor speed, etc.).
  

## 10/20/2025 - More Firmware  

Yay, more Firmware writing
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzkwMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--96403e483a0b755a914aabb29582354f3b1e53ed/image.png)
Anyway, let's first talk about #lounge exploding rn first time it has seen use in forever. Also, why did AWS go down? It was so annoying, I could do basically nothing. But back to my project, I basically just wrote a bunch of code for the firmware. That is it, I am tired and want to go to bed gn.  

## 10/21/2025 - *Finished Firmware  

So I finished the firmware!!
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDIxNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7e64469a65b6191012862d5a2b4a56ab94e8632c/image.png)
* Well, I sort of did. 
Software is never finished; I can just keep adding and adding, and I plan to. This is just it has enough that it will work, I can always change it. That is the great thing about software. Anyway some of the calculations may be off but this is because I don't have the motor or bike to base it off of. I am going to keep adding to it, but as of now, to the display!
  

## 10/22/2025 5 PM - Research & Schematic  

So I researched for a while, and I landed on the Pi Zero 2 W.
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU2OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6fd2efb287dfc8b247b4d17e009694db5245a198/image.png)
Most of the time spent on this journal was researching, I couldn't choose what to run my display on, and a display. I needed a ~3.5in display, and SPI just wouldn't really work, so the next abundant option was DSI. But another problem arose, the board I was planning on using, the Pi Zero 2 W, doesn't have DSI. So I was contemplating using a Compute module or using an HDMI display with the zero. I decided to use an HDMI display, even though it is a bit more expensive, it is easily swappable, so if anything ever goes wrong. This PCB isn't a complicated one, not supposed to be, mainly just supposed to organize my board.
  

## 10/22/2025 7 PM - Display PCB  

So I finished the Display PCB
![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDU3OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2bc1e2595868143400e8865724199583cefaddb9/image.png)
Again, just re-stating this is not supposed to be a complex PCB, just something to better organize my screen. So with that out of the way, now it is on to the most important part of this, making the customized OS. This custom OS will let me strip down to just what I need, further decreasing boot time, and as a bonus, it makes it seem more professional.  

## 10/25/2025 11 AM - Bike App  

I started work on the Bike app
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTQ2NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--24a473f7c6f2d85725f4cca788a7aaed30806331/image.png)
I think it looks really good. I am just working on the UI now, and functionality will come later. Also, quick update on this, I am really starting my YSWS rn and don't know if I will be able to finish this. I will try, but I might have to cut some things out.  

## 10/25/2025 2 PM - Way too many variables  

I have way way way to many variables.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--39f5abd616f51b6b0e33ffb597341941d46820f5/image.png)
Like it is absurd to creater this UART script it took 2 hrs of mindless copy and pasting. Anyway I am happy that it is done. I think that I still have to change a few things to make everything work all nice. I have to add a few more things and then v1 of the app will be done. I think since I am starting to get super busy I am going to strip out alot of what I planned but it still would be quite a advanced eBike and then through OTA updates keep adding.
  

## 10/25/2025 4 PM - Finish up Software  

I finished up the software. 
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTUzNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--d4f9e5b0feedd3e3632301108c10225ac0c55527/image.png)
So I finished up the rest of the app and fixed a few things with the controller firmware. Then I built the firmware, and I tried to build the app turns out you need to be on Linux. So I tried macOS turns out that doesn't count as Linux, so I had to go into Ubuntu and build it there. Surprisingly more complicated than I thought. Anyway, I have it all built, and now I have to get it ready for shipping.
  

## 10/25/2025 11 PM - Finishing Things Up  

This is by far the most time I have spent on one journal.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2440152016272448135fba9245d425a322155b4b/image.png)
This journal was a long one. I got everything ready for shipping. I made all my gerbers and BOMs for my PCB changed a good amount of my parts, just so I can get the PCBA cost down. README, organizing, and more. Always hated this part of hardware. It is always so boring and long. Anyway, I got some feedback that my project is at most a tier 2 and maybe a tier 3. That is not good at all. So I might add a GPS module, one problem with that is that although it will increase the price, something I am already over the tier 2 budget.
  

## 10/26/2025 - Finished  

Ok so I have finished it! I really wanted to get in GPS but I don't have the budget :(. I really need this to be a tier 2 project at least or some way to get the extra budget I am $35.39 over (which isn't that much) but I don't think I could cover that. I included the estimated price with GPS too just in case there is some way to get it covered. maybe by some miracle I can get tier 1 or some way to get the extra funds covered. I also researched the GPS module if I do get GPS I am going for the MAX-M10M-00B cheapest one I could find that is still well supported and accurate.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTc3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--02a111852c857e1da5ccd632dced7aabcc3a1be4/image.png)
  

## 10/30/2025 - Research Research Research  

Some say research is the thief of all joy.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg2MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--00efc03489d4fc69793eeb38d4877244492bba69/image.png)
So, I need to narrow my PCB down to 4 layers, but after **researching**, I noticed a VESC project. Basically, it is an open-source project for motor controllers, firmware, etc., which is great. However, the hardware schematics haven't been updated for a while. Also, while I would know that it would work well, I don't know; something is just wrong with it. It kind of defeats the purpose of doing all of this by myself. So I will probably not copy off of it, but I will take inspiration just to make sure my board is ready for this. Also, I think maybe I might switch to an STM32. I don't like it, but it does make a lot of sense for this project, and I think it is cheaper and smaller than an ESP.  

## 10/31/2025 - Project Journal?  

Well, I finally did it. I started a project journal.
![IMG_1542](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzI2OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--aa73d005171f7d1cbfa19cadc8502de49caa6619/IMG_1542.png)

As my projects get more and more advanced, I really need somewhere to document my research, my notes, etc. I am actually finding it very beneficial, plus it makes it seem more professional. Anyway, a lot of stuff happened in this session. I really started to research all of the different things I am doing. Like for the MCU, I am moving away from the ESP32 to the STM32G4. And still researching this, but switching from UART to CAN. I am very excited about it seems like it is a vast step up from UART tbh, no clue why I didn't start with it, mostly because the ESP doesn't have that, and I didn't know a lot about it. Last remark paper has its limits. I want an iPad so bad  

## 11/1/2025 1 PM - Last Bit of Research  

Well, I think I have done enough research to start working on the schematic.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQ1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--58fcbf750fe9dae9b885ae1c4f47c23cc077103c/image.png)
I have chosen new ICs for the buck converters. The LM2596HVS is for 48v to 5v. The TPS5430DDAR is for 5v to 3.3v. These, I feel, are going to help a lot. First of both are an all-in-one package, which is super nice. Then the LM2596HVS can do 3A, so that would also be nice. Both are also a lot less money. More went into it, but that was an overview. So here we go!  

## 11/1/2025 2 PM - PCB v3 Schematic  

I started work on PCB v3!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzQ5MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a3668d4a298a507899912396f088d1db928c90f4/image.png)
So I got rid of pretty much all power items to replace them. 5V was pretty easy; I needed an external inductor, which I thought I got rid of, but fine. Also, I changed to TD1501HS50. Then, for 3.3,v I was going to use a buck converter, but I realized I could just use an LDO. So I picked the AMS1117-3.3, and that circuit is very simple. I am now going to the STM32!
  

## 11/1/2025 8 PM - Simple FOC & Resaerch!  

I recently came across a project called [Simple FOC](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC).
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NzYxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--94e6e7519fb3c269a6ab5379d3a1ca9623f3c02a/image.png)
This looks like it will be super nice for me and work pretty easily with my Motor IC and STM32. I also came across this YouTuber [Great Scott](https://www.youtube.com/@greatscottlab). I watched a good amount of his videos to get a better grasp on FOC and Electric Motors.  

## 11/4/2025 - iPad!!!  

It has been a while, but great news, I got an iPad!!!!!

Facebook Marketplace is a lifesaver. So instead of having a physical notebook, I can have a digital one! So I transferred everything from my paper notebook to my iPad. 
I also set up the STM32 (at least the power pins) and researched more into how to develop with an STM32. I am very new to the whole STM32 thing. I might need to add an external oscillator, but idk.

## 11/5/2025 - STM32  

I am still working on the STM32.

I am going a lot slower now, but still making good progress. I have set up all the special pins on the STM32, and now it is completely configured, except for the remaining general-use pins. Turns out that even though the STM32 supports CAN, you still need a transceiver, so  I added that.
  

## 11/6/2025 - Finished MCU  

Well, I finally finished the MCU part of the schematic.

Pretty much, I just added all those Global Labels and also fixed a few things. Now all that is left for the schematic is the motor driver, but I just need to attach those pins to the new MCU pins. Oh, also, I made a nice little table on my iPad to tell me what each pin does and whether it is in use or not. I am fast approaching the PCB layout, and to say the least, I am scared but also excited.
  

## 11/7/2025 4 PM - Almost!  

I am finally almost done with the schematic!

So I have pretty much everything done, but ... I learned that supposedly you need bulk capacitors for the motor phases, so yay. Also, I have to add a few things to stop the current from reversing. Then, after all that, it goes on to my least favorite part, Footprints and LCSC IDs!
  

## 11/7/2025 5 PM - Schematic v3 Done!  

I finally finished v3 of the schematic.

So I changed a few things first, and probably most importantly, I had my MOSFETs wired wrong, which is embarrassing. I also didn't understand my driver's datasheet and wired VDRAIN wrong, but fixed that. So I think that is it, and time to go to footprints.  

## 11/7/2025 10 PM - Finished footprints v3 & Cost Optimization  

I finished the footprints, hopefully for the last time.

I hate footprints so much; it is so boring and tedious, but I got it out of the way. So, along with setting all the footprints, I also put in the LCSC ID for my BOM. I made sure to get all basic items. I think only two parts aren't basic, and they are the STM and the DRV. But onto the PCB. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI5MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ff7d56b64a02e47804718f5251d5f64550bb1f64/image.png)
This is going to be fun.
  

## 11/8/2025 12 PM - Fixed a few things on the schematic  

So I forgot a part on the schematic, but I fixed it.

I forgot to connect my connector data pins to my STM, so I had to find out what my sensors output (PWM, GPIO, etc.) Then I needed to use a level shifter to get them down to 3.3V LOGIC. I saved and updated everything, and now we have all of our components on the PCB, and we have to lay them out.
  

## 11/8/2025 4 PM - Started PCB v3  

I started PCB v3 and laid everything out
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTU3MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2022db395bf013b8071b9814a25b064f26dd23d1/image.png)
The amount of care and precision I am putting into this PCB revision is insane. Anyway, I grouped up all the different components and arranged them to make sure it looks good, follows the datasheet, and is clean. Then I routed some pins. I made a few minor adjustments to the schematic, but nothing major.
  

## 11/8/2025 10 PM - Almost there.  

I actually locked in so hard and am bascially done my PCB.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY1MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cb9b977bdf2a27eb4cc757b908c4e22dda0e7a07/image.png)
I only have three connections left and that is the Motor Phases. I seprated the Encoder from the actual motor for better compatiblity of diffrent motors. I took a lot of time and care and got the PCB routed all nice and neat and it looks great. Only thing now are the stupid Phases. I am moving to a Ring connector and why in the world is it so incredibly hard to get a footprint for it. That will be tommorow's job.
  

## 11/9/2025 9 AM - Finished PCB v3 & Cost optimization  

I finally finally finished hopefully the last PCB version
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTc0OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--95f54f4294c77354362c789b0042c14751f58263/image.png)
I really like how this came out it actually looks professional. Anyway I connected the remaining 3 lines. I ended up going with a ring connector reason being for higher motors like 2000w they use that and it is a better connector. I also shrnk the board just so I can be under 100mm so I don't have to pay extra! Now I am going to go check how much this is going to cost.
  

## 11/9/2025 1 PM - Finished Display v3. Low Cost  

The display board is done!!!!

You might notice there is a lot more on here than before and you would be right. I had to add a CAN controller and transiever. I also added a header to the side for DEBUG or a GPS module. Do you know what is funny the price of both of these boards combined is less then what the controller use to cost and I added stuff!
