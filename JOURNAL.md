## 10/10/2025 5 PM - Started KiCad Project  

Didn't really do a lot, just started the KiCad Project and labeled all the MCU pins for the controller.

Well, pretty much it, but I need 250 characters, so I will talk about blueprint. I kinda am liking it, it is obviously a continuation of Highway, but I like it. Ngl kinda feels unoriginal, but I still like it. 

It is basically Highway, but with some parts of SoM and more refined.  

## 10/10/2025 8 PM - Finished V1 Power Circuit  

I basically made the schematic for the power supply.

Most of the time was spent researching and seeing what I had to do to make sure it is safe and everything gets what it wants. I am debating getting the Power on a different board, but I don't think I will.
But now I have battery level, 3.3v (MCU), 5v (display), 12v (misc like lights). 
So far, kinda liking this, but I am dreading the day I have to make a case, especially waterproof :(
